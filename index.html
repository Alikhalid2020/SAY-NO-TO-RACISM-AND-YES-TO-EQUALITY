            <p>
                Racism is dead, but it is on life support-kept alive by politicians ,race hustlers <br>and people who get
                a
                sense
                of superiority by denouncing others<br> as “RACIST"  </p>
            <p><em>When a person places the proper value on freedom, there is nothing under the sun that he will not do to acquire that freedom. Whenever you hear a man saying he wants freedom, but in the next breath he is going to tell you what he won’t do to get it, or what he doesn’t believe in doing in order to get it, he doesn’t believe in freedom. A man who believes in freedom will do anything under the sun to acquire . . . or preserve his freedom.</em></p>
